Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
The STATION table is described as follows:

|  FIELD  |  TYPE  |
|  ---    |  ---   |
| ID      | NUMBER |
| CITY    | VARCHAR2 (21) |
| STATE   | VARCHAR2 (2) |
| LAT_N   | NUMBER | 
| LONG_W  | NUMBER |

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.
For example, if there are three records in the table with CITY values 'New York', 'New York', 'Bengalaru', there are 2 different city names: 'New York' and 'Bengalaru'. 
The query returns , because total number of records - number of unique city names = 3 - 2 = 1

SELECT count(city)- count (distinct city) FROM station;
