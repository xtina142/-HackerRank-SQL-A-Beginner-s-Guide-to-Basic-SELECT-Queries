Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Input Format
The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

|   Column  |  Type  |
|   ------  |  ----  |
|     A     | Integer |
|     B     | Integer |
|     C     | Integer |

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

Sample Input

|  A  |  B  |  C   |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| 20  | 20  |  23  |
| 20  | 20  |  20  |
| 20  | 21  |  22  |
| 13  | 14  |  30  |


Sample Output

Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle
Explanation

Values in the tuple (20, 20, 23) form an Isosceles triangle, because A = B.
Values in the tuple (20, 20, 20) form an Equilateral triangle, because A = B = C . Values in the tuple (20, 21, 22) form a Scalene triangle, because A=/ B =/ C .
Values in the tuple (13, 14, 30) cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C.

SELECT CASE WHEN A+B>C AND A+C>B AND B+C>A THEN
CASE WHEN A=B AND B=C THEN 'Equilateral'
WHEN A=B OR B=C OR A=C THEN 'Isosceles'
ELSE 'Scalene' END
ELSE 'Not A Triangle' END
FROM TRIANGLES;
